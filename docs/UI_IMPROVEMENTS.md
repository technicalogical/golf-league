---

### 11. **Mobile Responsiveness Review**

**Impact:** High
**Effort:** Large

The dashboard cards look great, but consider:
- Testing on actual mobile devices
- Ensure buttons are thumb-friendly (min 44px touch targets)
- Consider collapsing less-used actions on mobile

**Testing checklist:**
- [ ] Test on iPhone
- [ ] Test on Android
- [ ] Test landscape orientation
- [ ] Verify all touch targets are 44px+
- [ ] Check text readability

---

### 12. **Recent Activity - Make it Useful**
**Status:** Not Started
**Impact:** Medium
**Effort:** Medium

Instead of "No recent activity", show:

- Recent league announcements
- Friends' recent scores
- Makes dashboard feel more alive

**Files to modify:**
- `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Create `/app/api/activity/route.ts`
- Query upcoming matches, recent announcements

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Polish

### 13. **Color Coding**
**Status:** Not Started
**Impact:** Low
**Effort:** Small

- Use colors more strategically (green for active, yellow for upcoming, gray for ended)
- Team badges/colors (let captains pick a team color)
- Makes visual scanning easier

**Implementation:**
- Define color scheme in Tailwind config
- Create status badge component
- Add team_color to teams table

---

### 14. **Typography Hierarchy**
**Status:** Not Started
**Impact:** Low
**Effort:** Small

- Some headings feel similar in size
- Consider: Page title (largest) > Section title (medium) > Card title (smaller)
- Better visual hierarchy guides the eye

**Files to modify:**
- Review all heading sizes across app
- Establish consistent sizing scale

---

### 15. **Spacing & White Space**
**Status:** Not Started
**Impact:** Low
**Effort:** Small

**Files to modify:**

1. âœ… Quick Overview Widget (Major impact, relatively easy)
