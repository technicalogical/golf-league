## Scoring System Details

### Rules Implemented

1. **Team Format**: 2v2 matches
2. **Matchups**: Lowest handicap vs lowest, highest vs highest
3. **Stroke Allocation**:
   - Par 3s: NO strokes given
   - Par 4s & 5s: Strokes given based on handicap diff and hole handicap index
4. **Points**:
   - Win a hole = 1 point per player
   - Lowest team net total = 1 point
5. **Handicaps**: Snapshot at match time, can change throughout season

### Key Algorithms

**`lib/scoring.ts`** contains:
- `calculateMatchup()` - Head-to-head scoring between 2 players
- `calculateTeamMatch()` - Full 2v2 match with both matchups
- `getStrokesForHole()` - Determines stroke allocation per hole

## Database Schema

### Tables
1. **profiles** - User accounts (linked to Auth0)
2. **teams** - Team information
3. **players** - Player data with handicaps
4. **courses** - Golf courses
5. **holes** - Hole details (par, handicap index)
6. **matches** - Match scheduling
7. **scorecards** - Player scores per match
8. **hole_scores** - Individual hole scores

### Key Relationships
- Players → Profiles (one-to-one)
- Players → Teams (many-to-one)
- Matches → Teams (many-to-many via team1_id, team2_id)
- Scorecards → Matches + Players
- Hole Scores → Scorecards + Holes

## API Endpoints

### `POST /api/matches/[id]/scores`
**Purpose**: Submit scorecard and calculate results

**Input**:
```json
{
  "scores": [
    {
      "player_id": "uuid",
      "hole_id": "uuid",
      "strokes": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

**Process**:
1. Validates match exists with 4 players
2. Organizes scores by team
3. Runs scoring calculations
4. Saves hole scores with points
5. Updates scorecards with totals
6. Marks match as completed

**Output**: Match results with point breakdown

### `GET /api/standings`
**Purpose**: Calculate league standings

**Process**:
1. Fetches all teams and players
2. Aggregates points from completed matches
3. Calculates wins/losses/ties for teams
4. Computes averages and best scores for players
5. Sorts by total points

**Output**:
```json
{
  "teams": [{ "team_id", "team_name", "total_points", "wins", "losses", "ties" }],
  "players": [{ "player_id", "player_name", "total_points", "avg_score", "best_score" }]
}
```

## What's NOT Built Yet (Future Enhancements)

### Admin Dashboard
- Course management UI
- Team creation/editing

### Additional Features
- Match history view
- Player profile pages
- Statistics dashboard
- AboutGolf API integration (when available)

- Team permissions

## Next Steps to Deploy

1. **Complete Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Set up Supabase project
   # Set up Auth0 application
   # Configure .env.local
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Add Initial Data**:
   - Use QUICKSTART.md guide
   - Add at least one course with 18 holes
   - Create 2+ teams
   - Add players after they sign in

3. **Test Flow**:
   - Create a match
   - Enter scores via scorecard
   - Verify calculations
   - Check standings update

4. **Build Admin UI**:
   - Create `/admin` routes
   - Add course/team/player management
   - Add match scheduling

5. **Deploy**:
   - Push to GitHub
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Update Auth0 URLs
   - Test production

## Technical Decisions Made

### Why Next.js + Supabase?
- Server-side rendering for SEO
- API routes built-in
- Supabase provides instant backend
- Easy scaling
- Great developer experience

### Why Auth0?
- Requested by user
- Supports multiple SSO providers
- Enterprise-ready
- Easy migration path

### Why TypeScript?
- Type safety prevents bugs
- Better IDE support
- Self-documenting code
- Easier refactoring

### Database Design Choices
- **Handicap snapshot**: Stored in scorecards to preserve historical accuracy
- **Separate hole_scores table**: Allows detailed hole analysis
- **Status enum**: Tracks match lifecycle (scheduled → in_progress → completed)
- **UUIDs**: Better for distributed systems, prevents enumeration attacks

## Performance Considerations

### Current Setup
- Client-side React components
- Server-side API routes
- Supabase indexes on foreign keys
- Efficient queries with joins

### Future Optimizations
- Add Redis caching for standings
- Implement pagination for match history
- Add database views for complex queries
- Consider edge functions for real-time updates

## Security Features

- [x] Auth0 authentication required
- [x] Server-side API validation
- [x] Row-level security ready (not implemented yet)
- [ ] Admin role checks
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Rate limiting

## AboutGolf API Status

**Current**: No public API available
**Solution**: Manual course entry via SQL or admin UI
**Future**: Monitor for API release, implement integration when available

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Add tests for `lib/scoring.ts` functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints
3. **E2E Tests**: Use Playwright for full user flows
4. **Manual Testing**: Test with real match scenarios

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Auth0 URLs updated
- [ ] Initial data loaded
- [ ] Test match completed
- [ ] Standings verified
- [ ] Mobile responsive checked
- [ ] Error handling tested

- Watch for Auth0 changes
- Check Supabase updates

## Success Metrics

Track these to measure success:

- Page load times
- Error rates
- Mobile usage
